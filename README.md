## History

- This is a fork of Jay Walter's [SourceForge repository](<https://sourceforge.net/p/remoteteanet>).

- It was later forked from [Wes Day's GitHub repository](https://github.com/wespday/RemoteTea.Net).

- Then it was updated to support .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.72 as the 'GB1.RemoteTea.Net' NuGet package at this location:

      https://www.nuget.org/packages/GB1.RemoteTea.Net/

- The `master` branch is currently being used in a [pull request to update
Wes Day's GitHub repository](https://github.com/wespday/RemoteTea.Net/pull/1).

- The default branch is set to `GB1.RemoteTea.NetMaster` and this will be considered 
the “base” branch in this repository, against which all pull requests and code commits 
are automatically made, unless you specify a different branch.
